#### CEO of Analytical and Collaborative Solutions, 2012-2015

Why? We wanted an extensible, graphical software product to perform scientifically valid, sharable data analysis.
How? Utilizing Java swing, maven, fenix, ...
What? We wrote Adapt, which performs this functionality.

Why? Needed to find unique DNA sequences to influence design of detecting mechanisms.
How? Utilizing NCBI(???) BLAST(???) as well as open source bioinformatics software libraries, written in C++ and Java.
What? GeneCapture Probe Design Gadget allows development of automated viral and biological pathogen detection.

#### Systems Engineer at Wyle Inc. 2009-2015

Why? Understand electromagnetic profiles of ballistic weapons, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and rotary wing aircraft to perform radar tracking discrimination. Accurate discrimination allows for location specific "hit-the-deck" warnings to impact victims, increasing their effectiveness.
How? Image processing and machine learning techniques design required a graphical display of electromagnetic wave sensation data.
What? Sum Power Map Viewer displays the three-dimensional antenna return data. Range, Range rate, and summation of normalized power returns allow for 

Image processing and machine learning techniques design required a
We also designed software to monitor protein crystal growth by controlling a camera mounted to a three axis motor system. We controlled motors, liquid pumps, and cameras to measure crystal growth rates over time by autonomously capturing and processing images. This software is integrated into prototype hardware that was designed by a biotech company and will be used to gather data for a publication resulting from NASA funded research.
