## Profile
Multi-disciplined engineer with ten years of software development experience. Can start and finish products. Enjoys solving problems with others. Values honesty in communications. Experience with U.S. military methods used to plan and deliver.

## Experience
#### CEO of Analytical and Collaborative Solutions, 2012-2015
Roles: Business strategy, customer development, product design, and software developer.

Objective: _Improve productivity of data analysts and the accuracy of their analysis._
I co-developed _Adapt_, an extensible, graphical software product that is a framework to generate fast, reproducible, and sharable data analysis. Utilizing Java swing, Apache Maven, and Apache Felix, _Adapt_ provides software developers a library for file input or database connections, UI/UX functionality, application templates, and interfaces for app-to-app communication.

Objective: _Detect biological and viral pathogens in an automated system._ I co-developed the GeneCapture Probe Design Gadget, built with _Adapt_, which enables the engineering of DNA sequences. Utilizing Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, as well as other open source bioinformatics software libraries, this gadget written in C++ and Java. it finds unique DNA sequences that dictate the design of detecting mechanisms. Image processing and classification is written in Python and also leverages open source software.

#### Systems Engineer at Wyle Inc. 2009-2015

Roles: System Engineer, Radar Algorithm Designer, and Data Analyst

Objective: _Improve soldier survival chances against a ballistic weapon attack._

How? Understand electromagnetic profiles of ballistic weapons, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and rotary wing aircraft to perform radar tracking discrimination. Accurate discrimination allows for location specific "hit-the-deck" warnings to impact victims, increasing their effectiveness.
Image processing and machine learning techniques design required a graphical display of electromagnetic wave sensation data.

What? Sum Power Map Viewer displays the three-dimensional antenna return data. Range, Range rate, and summation of normalized power returns allow for blah.

Objective: _Improve destruction percentage of in-coming ballistic weapons._

## Addition strengths
__Business development and administration__:
Leadership experience in product and customer development. Coordination of multiple products across wide geographic area between collaborators. Agile practices and test-driven development provide a solid foundation for software production, planning, and group accountability.

__C++__: Designed and developed a method of real-time support vector machine based ballistic target discrimination. Radar measurements were processed and compared against a pre-trained hyperplane for classification. High accuracy discrimination improves: ballistic target detection, impact and origin location determination, and warning time to take cover.

__Python__: Co-developed coordinate transformations and other mathematical libraries. Also contributed to Global Matching Engine, a software framework for radar system performance analysis. Wrote software to plan and analyze antenna alignment, aircraft profiles, and radar test objectives using Google Earth, along with additional graphs.

## Education
**Master of Science in Engineering** University of Alabama in Huntsville, 2015

**Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering** University of Alabama in Huntsville, 2009

## Personal
I am blessed with the time to write, cook, and read. I seek with enthusiasm big and difficult ideas.
