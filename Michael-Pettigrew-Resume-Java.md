##### Profile
Michael is a multi-disciplined engineer with ten years of software development experience. He enjoys solving problems with others, values honesty in communications, and has experience planning and deliver products.

##### Experience
__Chief Operating Officer, Black Label Data, 2015-present__

Roles: Software developer, marketing, customer development

Objective: _Simple, private file storage._ I am a co-founder of [Black Label Data](https://blacklabeldata.io), where we are committed to data privacy. We developed [Arkham Storage](https://arkham.io) to provide anonymous, zero-knowledge file storage. The encryption library that provides the privacy will be accessible to API customers. My primary role is a Golang developer.

__Chief Executive Officer, Analytical and Collaborative Solutions, 2012-2015__
Roles: Software developer, business strategy, customer development, product design

Objective: _Improve productivity of data analysts and the accuracy of their analysis._
I co-developed _Adapt_, an extensible, graphical software product that is a framework for developers to generate fast, reproducible, and sharable data analysis. Utilizing Java Swing, Apache Maven, and Apache Felix, _Adapt_ provides software developers simple file input or database connections, UI/UX functionality, application templates, and interfaces for intra application communication.

Objective: _Detect biological and viral pathogens in an automated system._ I co-developed the _GeneCapture Probe Design Gadget_, built with _Adapt_, which enables the engineering of DNA sequences required for a novel pathogen detection process. It finds unique DNA sequences that dictate the design of detecting mechanisms. Utilizing Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, software developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, as well as other open source bioinformatics software libraries, this "Gadget" was written in Java and C++. I also co-developed image processing and classification software, written in Java and Python, used in GeneCapture's prototype hardware.

__Systems Engineer, Wyle Inc., 2009-2015__

Roles: System engineer, software developer, radar algorithm designer, subject matter expert, data analyst

Objective: _Improve human survival rates against ballistic weapon attacks._ I developed a graphical data analysis tool used by analysts and system designers to understand the electromagnetic sensation capability of a RADAR system against ballistic weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and rotary wing aircraft. RADARs have limited resources, so the algorithms they utilize to detect and track targets must be highly optimized. The _Sum Power Map Viewer_  product displays three-dimensional antenna measurements correlated to other RADAR system logs allowing for deep technical analysis. Range, range rate of change, and summation of normalized power were viewable as heat map images. These images were used in the final quality assurance step before sale of the system. System improvements originating from this tool improved target detection performance and discrimination accuracy, both result in more "take cover" warning time to those under threat.

Objective: _Improve countermeasures against ballistic weapon attacks._ I contributed to the development of a data analysis tool suite, written in Java, that incorporates weapon system measurements, network command messages, and physical defense logic, in order to: calculate performance metrics, provide network timing validation, study target dynamics, and identify system shortfalls. I also designed and maintained the interface between these Java libraries as well as a MATLAB charting tool for system engineers.

##### Addition strengths
__Business development and administration:__ Leadership experience in product and customer development. Coordination of multiple products across wide geographic area between collaborators. Agile practices and test-driven development provide a solid foundation for software production, planning, and group accountability.

__C++:__ Designed and developed a method of real-time support vector machine based ballistic target discrimination. Radar measurements were processed and compared against a pre-trained hyperplane for classification. High accuracy discrimination improves: ballistic target detection, impact and origin location determination, and warning time to take cover.

__Python:__ Co-developed coordinate transformations and other mathematical libraries. Also contributed to Global Matching Engine, a software framework for radar system performance analysis. Wrote software to plan and analyze antenna alignment, aircraft profiles, and radar test objectives using Google Earth, along with additional graphs.

##### Education
__Master of Science in Engineering University of Alabama in Huntsville, 2015__

__Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering University of Alabama in Huntsville, 2009__

##### Personal
I am blessed with the time to write, cook, and read. I seek with enthusiasm big and difficult ideas.
