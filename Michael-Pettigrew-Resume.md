## Profile
Multi-disciplined engineer with ten years experience. Can start and finish projects. Enjoys solving problems with others. Values honesty in communications. Experience with the methods the U.S. military uses to plan and deliver.

## Experience
#### COO of [Black Label Data](http://blacklabeldata.github.io/), 2015-present
My roles are: marketing, customer development, strategy, and software development. Our work environment and designs utilize lean processes, including their applications to software production.

We are building an end-to-end encrypted and anonymous cloud file storage product.

#### CEO of Analytical and Collaborative Solutions, 2012-2015

My roles were to lead a small group of engineers in designing software primarily for biotech applications. I communicated with clients and team members, performed market research, tracked progress, wrote proposals and reports, and developed software.


Our team built an extensible data analysis software product. This was used to find sections of DNA that were unique to different organisms, and is currently licensed to a biotech company. We developed, for the same biotech company, image processing software to detect fluorescence in low-light conditions.

We also designed software to monitor protein crystal growth by controlling a camera mounted to a three axis motor system. We controlled motors, liquid pumps, and cameras to measure crystal growth rates over time by autonomously capturing and processing images. This software is integrated into prototype hardware that was designed by a biotech company and will be used to gather data for a publication resulting from NASA funded research.

#### Systems Engineer at Wyle Inc. 2009-2015

My role was to provide scientific, engineering, and technical assistance concerning radars in the U.S. Army Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar program. I grew into a junior lead role on a team of eight engineers.

Radars are carefully configured antennas controlled by a computer. The computer requires instructions that drive electromagnetic wave propagation and sensation. These instructions are tested with theoretically accurate simulations. I worked with others in writing software to find the instructions that maximize a radars capability and performance.

I contributed to as well as managed the configuration of multiple software applications and libraries. I wrote software to perform automated data analysis of thousands of data collection events on hundreds of U.S. Army radars.

Our group was also required to prove our proposed radar improvements through live test events. We wrote software tools to plan these tests. Using additional statistical analysis software, we developed a process to verify our improvements or identify shortfalls.

I also designed and developed a ballistic target classification algorithm for radars using support vector machine methodology. I oversaw the project from a MATLAB prototype to a real-time C++ application. This algorithm works in real time and was implemented in an Army radar. In addition to coordinating this project with the radar prime contractor, I trained three coworkers to continue improving and developing the classifier.
